# OSY Practicals

All practicals / assignments given in OSY Lab are covered as per SPPU 2019 pattern. This repository is useful for Computer and AI&DS students studying at SPPU.

# Practicals List
1. Given list of processes ,their CPU burst Time Display Gant chart for FCFS,SJF ,priority and round-robin scheduling algorithm compute and print average waitig time and average turnaround time.

2. Implement Producer-consumer problem using counting semaphore and mutex.

3. Demonstrate readers writers problem with reader priority or writer.

4. Write a program to implement Bankers Algorithm.

5. Write a program for Simulation of Page replacement algorithms(FIFO, Optimal).

6. Write a program for Simulation of Page replacement algorithms using LRU.

7. Implement UNIX system calls like ps, fork, join, exec family, and wait for process management (use shell script/ Java/ C programming).

8. Create a Shell program to do mathematical operations.

9. Write a shell program to find string in file using grep option.

10. FIFO : full duplex communication between two independent processes. first process accept sentence and writes on one pipe to be read by second process and second process counts no of char, word 7 lines in accepted sentence. write this o/p in txt file and writes the contents of the file on second pipe to be read by first process and display on standard output.
