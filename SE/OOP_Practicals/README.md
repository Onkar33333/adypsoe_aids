# OOP Practicals

All practicals / assignments given in OOP Lab are covered as per SPPU 2019 pattern. This repository is useful for Computer and AI&DS students studying at SPPU.

# Practicals List
1. Implement a class Complex which represents the Complex Number data type. Implement the following :  
    a) Constructor (including a default constructor which creates the complex number 0+0i).  
    b) Overload operator+ to add two complex numbers.  
    c) Overload operator* to multiply two complex numbers.  
    d) Overload operators << and >> to print and read Complex Numbers

2. Develop a program in C++ to create a database of student's information system containing the following information:  
Name, Roll number, Class, Division, Date of Birth, Blood group, Contact address, Telephone number, Driving license no. and other. Construct the database with suitable member functions. Make use of constructor, default constructor, copy constructor, destructor, static member functions, friend class, this pointer, inline code and dynamic memory allocation operators-new and delete as well as exception handling.

3. Imagine a publishing company which does marketing for book and audiocassette versions.
Create a class publication that stores the title (a string) and price (type float) of a publication. From this class derive two classes: book, which adds a page count(type int), and tape, which adds a playing time in minutes(type float). Write a program that 
instantiates the book and tape classes, allows user to enter data and displays the data members. If an exception is caught, replace all the data member values with zero values.

4. Write a C++ program that creates an output file, writes information to it, closes the file, open it again as an input file and read the information from the file.

5. Write a function template for selection sort that inputs, sorts and outputs an integer array and a float array.

6.
    a) Write C++ program using STL for sorting and searching user defined records such as personal records (Name, DOB, Telephone numbers, etc) using vector container.  
    b) Write C++ Program using STL for sorting and searching user defined records such as item records (Item code, name, cost, quantity) using vector container.

7. Write a program in C++ to use map associative container.
The keys will be the names of states and the values will be the populations of the states. When the program runs, the user is prompted to type the name of the state. The program then loops in th emap, using the state name as an index and returns the population of the state.
