# DL Practicals

1. Real estate agents want help to predict the house price for regions in the USA. He gave you the dataset to work on and you decided to use the Linear Regression Model. Create a model that will help him to estimate what the house would sell for.

2. Build a Multiclass classifier using the CNN model. Use MNIST or any other suitable dataset.

3. Design RNN or its variant including LSTM or GRU.  
a) Select a suitable time series dataset. Example â€“ predict sentiments based on product reviews  
b) Apply for prediction

4. Design and implement a CNN for Image Classification.  
a) Select a suitable image classification dataset (medical imaging, agricultural, etc.).  
b) Optimized with different hyper-parameters including learning rate, filter  size, no. of layers, optimizers, dropouts, etc.

5. Perform Sentiment Analysis in the network graph using RNN.
